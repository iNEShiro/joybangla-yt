**Note**: this module uses recent discordjs features and requires discord.js version 12.

Discord Player is a powerful [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) module that allows you to easily implement music commands. **Everything** is customizable, and everything is done to simplify your work **without limiting you**! It doesn't require any api key, as it uses **scraping**.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save discord-player
```

Install **@discordjs/opus**:

```sh
npm install --save @discordjs/opus
```

Install [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) and you're done!
